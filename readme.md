# US Poverty Level impact on Hospital Bed Utilization.
## by Jagadeesh Josyula

To better understand how socioeconomic status - such as populations living in federal poverty area impact hospital bed utilization and to help optimize scenario planning for when staff can be shifted around to serve those living in federal poverty areas.

## Investigation Overview ##

In this investigation, I wanted to look at Historical Bed Utilization Rate, Poverty Level, Potential available in Bed capacity and Hospital type are key features that could help forecast the staffing needs of health workers (doctors, nurses etc). The staffing needs to a specific hospital type can be scored based on the availability enabling counties in poverty to be better served.

As next steps, building a machine learning model that helps support and augment health workers where demand exists by integrating with existing staff scheduling system allowing systems to view the model recommendations, allowing healthcare stakeholders deliver better patient care and improving productivity.



## Dataset

This project explores a dataset containing Hospital Bed data for approximately 6621 hospitals across all counties in United States. To better understand how US Poverty Level impact on Hospital Bed Utilization, the poverty level data is sourced from usda public data that provides the poverty level at county level.

## Summary of Findings ##

With increased poverty level, there is increase in bed availability.The intresting fact that this availability can be made available to hospitals with high bed utilization.

Short term Acute Care hospitals is shown to have the major percentage of increased bed availability.

Potential increase in bed capacity are availabe in MS, LA and KY States - where the short term acute care hospitals have 11% to 14% of increased bed capacity.
